revisnotes
==========

A Symfony project created on July 30, 2017, 11:34 pm.


Revisnotes is a site created with the Symfony framework. It allows you to take notes and review your notes. This is to master the subject (s) you wish to work on.

Revisnotes is currently being developed under Symfony 3. Regular improvements will be made.

The current version is an alpha version. Everything is not yet perfect and you are welcome to advise me or to participate in the project.

Currently, under Revisnotes, you can:
- You have access to a contact form for all questions.
- You have the possibility to create an account 
- Add categories with associated notes. 
- Delete/Modify a note or category
- You can set your revision period
- You are informed of the notes to be revised
- You can review your grades and self-assess yourself.
 
 
 The goal of Revisnotes is to help people who want to progress in an area to review in a simple way.
 This concerns all types of domains and not just IT.
